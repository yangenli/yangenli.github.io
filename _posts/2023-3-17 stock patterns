Abstract:
Technical analysis is the study of predicting future asset prices using historical
information. Rather than testing predetermined distributions or patterns, we are
considering adopting a new method known as Matrix Profile to study price charts
directly. The price chart at the stock level will be the primary focus of our investiga-
tion. We find that certain stock price patterns tend to repeat frequently. In addition,
the repeating price chart we identified has a certain level of predictive potential,
even out of sample.
