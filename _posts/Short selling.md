Abstract: Many countries around the world reacted to the COVID-19 crisis by imposing bans on short selling. Using firm level short selling data and order level stock trading data, we identify the effect of short selling on stock price behaviors around the Coronavirus crash. We find that in general short selling is positively associated with both volatility and price discovery, before and during the market crash. Moreover, short selling does not further increase volatility or slow down price discovery during the market crash, relative to pre-crash period. Interestingly, we find that short selling has a negative impact on volatility when stock market crashes most significantly.
